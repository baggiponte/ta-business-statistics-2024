# Lecture outline

This lecture introduces the `{tidyverse}`, a collection of libraries designed to streamline data manipulation and visualisation.

The lecture will cover the following:

* Introduction to the penguins dataset
* Definition of exploratory data analysis
* Introduction to the grammar of graphics
* Plotting charts to visualise individual variables (both quantitative and categorical).

# Required libraries

You will likely need to install the `{tidyverse}` and `{palmerpenguins}` with `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "palmerpenguins"))`. The `{patchwork}` library is an extra to display plots together: while it is required to execute this code, it won't be covered.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(palmerpenguins)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

# Introduction to the Palmer Penguins Dataset

![Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/lter_penguins.png)

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular dataset for practicing data analysis and visualization. It provides information about three species of penguins observed in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The dataset includes measurements of various physical attributes of the penguins, such as their flipper lengths and body masses, as well as other details like their species and the island they were observed on.

# Data Dictionary

Here is a brief description of each variable in the dataset:

1.  **species**: The species of the penguin (categorical: "Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo").
2.  **island**: The island where the penguin was observed (categorical: "Torgersen", "Biscoe", "Dream").
3.  **bill_length_mm**: The length of the penguin's bill (continuous, measured in millimeters).
4.  **bill_depth_mm**: The depth of the penguin's bill (continuous, measured in millimeters).
5.  **flipper_length_mm**: The length of the penguin's flipper (continuous, measured in millimeters).
6.  **body_mass_g**: The body mass of the penguin (continuous, measured in grams).
7.  **sex**: The sex of the penguin (categorical: "male", "female").
8.  **year**: The year of observation (categorical: 2007, 2008, 2009).

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Palmer Penguins dataset. We will use the `ggplot2` package to visualize the distribution of each variable.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process where the primary goal is to examine the data, uncover underlying patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical summaries and graphical representations. EDA helps in understanding the data's structure, identifying the most important variables, and gaining insights that guide further analysis.

To quote Arthur Schopenhauer, "The alchemists in their search for gold discovered many other things of greater value." This aptly describes the essence of EDA: while we may start with a specific question or objective, the process often reveals unexpected and valuable insights that can significantly enhance our understanding of the dataset.

# Distribution of Quantitative Variables

The first step of EDA is to inspect the distribution of individual variables. *Hint*: pay close attention to the scales, as well as the extreme values!

## Bill Length and Bill Depth Distribution

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "darkorange", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Bill Length", x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Frequency")

p2 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightyellow", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Bill Depth", x = "Bill Depth (mm)", y = "Frequency")

p1 / p2
```

- **`geom_histogram`**: Creates histograms to visualize the distribution of continuous variables.
- **`binwidth`**: Sets the width of the bins in the histogram.
- **`labs`**: Adds titles and labels to the plots.

## Flipper Length Distribution

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightcoral", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Flipper Length", x = "Flipper Length (mm)", y = "Frequency")
```

- **`geom_histogram`**: Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of flipper length.
- **`binwidth`**: Sets the width of the bins in the histogram.
- **`labs`**: Adds a title and labels to the plot.

## Body Mass Distribution

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "cyan4", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass", x = "Body Mass (g)", y = "Frequency")
```

- **`geom_histogram`**: Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of body mass.
- **`binwidth`**: Sets the width of the bins in the histogram.
- **`labs`**: Adds a title and labels to the plot.

# Distribution of Categorical Variables

Categorical variables usually bear a lot of meaning: in this case, for example, they encode our expectations about significant physiological differences about individual samples.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Categorical variables", x = "Species", y = "Count")

p2 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightcoral") +
  labs(title = "", x = "Island", y = "Count")

p3 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "", x = "Sex", y = "Count")

p1 / p2 / p3
```

- **`geom_bar`**: Creates bar plots to visualize the count of different categories.
- **`labs`**: Adds titles and labels to the plots.
- The last row combines the three plots to generate a unique picture.
